                    <p>Woman, no word can say how important you are. You are the breath of fresh air in the hottest summer days, the smell of flowers in the spring, the early morning sunshine in the late winter that brings the first life into the world, the sound of birds singing, and the smell of the sea. You are a sweet sip of latte when I get home from a long day, you are the tomorrow, you are the most gorgeous lady I have ever seen.</p>
                    <p>I remember the very first day we met and I remember our first kiss when I realized that this tiny girl with brown eyes, prettiest lips, and the most adorable cheeks was becoming mine, and I am never going to forget it, you are the person whose laught sounds like the life itself and whose smiles shines like thousand sunrises, you are the woman whose hair smells like home and whose touch feels like peace.</p>
                    <p>You are somebody to be proud of, you are somebody to cherish and you are somebody who deserves to be happy and I am so ready to be by your side in every single moment of your life.</p>
